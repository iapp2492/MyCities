# MyCitiesNg (Frontend)

Angular frontend for **MyCities**, a full-stack mapping application that visualizes cities that I have lived in.

## What’s here
- Map UI with pluggable engines (Leaflet / Google Maps / Mapbox)
- Filter bar (decade, stay duration, basemap)
- Marker rendering and popup details
- Unit tests for key components

## Prerequisites
- Node.js + npm
- Backend running locally (see `/MyCitiesWebApi`)

## Run locally
```bash
npm install
npm start
